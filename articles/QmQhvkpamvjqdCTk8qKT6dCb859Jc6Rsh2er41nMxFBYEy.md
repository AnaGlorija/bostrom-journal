# BOOT token

BOOT is the main token of Bostrom. The token's name BOOT symbolizes the BOOTloader nature of the Bostrom network for the future Cyber network.

With BOOT one can:

- `hire a hero` (to delegate tokens to a validator), being paid rewards in return (risk fee);
  - for each staked BOOT a HYDROGEN is minted (with a 1 to 1 ratio);
- pay for network transactions (pay for gas). Though now, many validators accept transactions with 0 gas fee;
- vote for protocol changes and public goods.
