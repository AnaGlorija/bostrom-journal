# State machine

At its core, a blockchain is a replicated deterministic state machine.

A state machine is a computer science concept whereby a machine can have multiple states, but only one at any given time. There is a state, which describes the current state of the system, and transactions, that trigger state transitions.

Given a state S and a transaction T, the state machine will return a new state S'.

In a blockchain context, the state machine is deterministic. This means that if a node is started at a given state and replays the same sequence of transactions, it will always end up with the same final state.

A validator (a hero in Bostrom terminology) is a server with running blockchain software (node).

Each node contains a blockchain replica (transaction log) that allows computing the system’s current state for each block. Nodes agree among themselves on a current state according to the Tendermint consensus protocol.
