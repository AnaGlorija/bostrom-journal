## cyberCongress

cyberCongress is supranational community. 11.6% is owned by cyberCongress.

cyberCongress operations are public:

- [multisig in Bostrom](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/contract/bostrom1xszmhkfjs3s00z2nvtn7evqxw3dtus6yr8e4pw)
- [Aragon in Ethereum](https://client.aragon.org/#/cybercongress/0xa0a55e68dc52b47f8a9d5d05329fab5bdabffb14/)

cyberCongress as a community led launch of Bostrom. A detailed strategy of cyberCongress fund management will be published soon.

## Investors

5 public rounds attracted 91 individuals. Thanks to them the project was able to flourish for 5 years prior to launch. More than ~5000 ETH has been spent on the project.

## Senate

5.1% is stored in the common goods pool of the [Senate](https://cyb.ai/senate). Every BOOT holder decides where these funds should be allocated.

## Cyberpunks

During Game of Links the [Euler foundation](https://client.aragon.org/#/eulerfoundation/0x34291feae53ad4e155a20de02585eb115ef5d373/) was created. Those who created it got [GOL tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4ecdBa8ba4144Ff3a2d8792Cad9051431Aa4F64).

The Euler foundation will transform into the Great Web Foundation. 5% of BOOT and TOCYB genesis stake is under GOL token holders' management. Currently cyberCongress is a [key holder](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/contract/bostrom1ha4pw9w2qgc2ce9jwfrwrmaft5fneus58nqwev), but only GOL holders can decide on the future of these funds.

Those who create The Great Web foundation are true cyberpunks.

## Inventors

The project exists thanks to the passion of [@mastercyb](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/contract/bostrom1gxhs5wzam5rlgf6cs0lkme400ut64d4ncpfs2h) and [@cyberhead](bostrom16230lc9r27vrxlzd4wlvcz2l66quzj84vlkxc5). They got 1% each.

## Heroes

Before Genesis, a group of heroes helped to run and test 6 euler and 6 bostrom tesnets. Overall 142 individuals got 0.6% from genesis for their work.

## Hackers

9 individuals earned different grants and bounties for outside code colaboration.

## Masters

During Game of Links 332 individuals helped to test key mechanics of superintelligence. Thanks to their work cyberCongress was able to identify a lot of design problems.
