# Preface

This document is intended to provide the brief and necessary information for understanding the potential of Bostrom's blockchain, explaining its features and capabilities. I am neither the founder nor the developer of Bostrom, though I had the luck to communicate with them and develop my understanding of Bostrom's mechanics, which I am sharing here.

There are documents about Bostrom's blockchain written by Bostrom's founders or the cyberCongress team:

- Whitepaper [~](QmUbFsWDVnVBSisBTZpkQHtEMqpQkdh93EWpkqouQSYmuW), [github](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/computing-the-knowledge/computing-the-knowledge.md)
- Cyber roadmap [~](QmSBYCCYFNfHNQD7MWm4zBaNuztMaT2KghA2SbeZZm9vLH)
- Particles by mastercyb (cofounder of Bostrom) [~](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/contract/bostrom1d8754xqa9245pctlfcyv8eah468neqzn3a0y0t)
- Particles by cyberCongress [~](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/contract/bostrom1xszmhkfjs3s00z2nvtn7evqxw3dtus6yr8e4pw)
- [Cyber's story](https://cyb.ai/genesis)
- Docs on go-cyber (`.md` files) scattered all over the folders of go-cyber repository on the [github](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber)

If you are interested in researching Bostrom, all of these sources can give you a lot of information. Nevertheless, I believe that this manual is a good starting point.
