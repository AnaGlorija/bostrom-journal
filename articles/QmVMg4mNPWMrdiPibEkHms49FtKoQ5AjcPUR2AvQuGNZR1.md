# AMPERE token

- is needed to create cyberlinks;
- amount of Ampere tokens on a balance of the selected neuron is used to compute `ampere-per-cyberlink` metric, which is used in cyberrank algorithm.

The more Ampere tokens the neuron has, the higher his cyberlinks would be ranked. Cyberrank is recalculated for each `cycle` so that the changes in the amount of Ampere tokens on the neurons' balances that produced cyberlinks would influence the cyberrank of the whole graph. It's reasonable to think of Ampere tokens as a measure that characterizes the impact of cyberlinks created from the account on the knowledge graph.
