# Bostrom's Governance

The governance process of [Cyber networks](https://cyb.ai/search/computing%20knowledge) is focused on the [evolution](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20evolution) of its code and is based on 3 methods:

- [self-reflection](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20self-reflection)
- [investments](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20investments)
- [adaptation](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20adaptation)

Everyone can submit proposals.

A proposal can become active if [minimum deposit](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov) is submitted by network participants in the [max deposit period](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov).

During [voting period](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov) proposal have to reach [quorum](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov). The threshold is defined as the minimum proportion of Yes votes excluding Abstain votes for the proposal to be accepted. More details in [cosmos-sdk docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/gov/).
