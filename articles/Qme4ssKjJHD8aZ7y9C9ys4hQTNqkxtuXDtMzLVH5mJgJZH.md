# Cyberrank

Cyberrank is a default rank calculated of each particle. It's calculated as a weighted Pagerank, where every cyberlink has the weight of `ampere-per-cyberlink`. `ampere-per-cyberlink` is calculated for each neuron by dividing his ampere balance by a number of his cyberlinks.

Cyberrank is calculated by using GPU of the node. Cyberrank is deterministic, and it is used in Bostrom's blockchain consensus.
