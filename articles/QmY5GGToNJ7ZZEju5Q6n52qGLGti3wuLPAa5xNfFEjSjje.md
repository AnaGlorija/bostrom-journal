# Knowledge graph

The knowledge graph of Bostrom blockchain consists of pairs: each source particle is connected to a destination particle via cyberlink (with additional information of neuron's address and the height info). So it can be encoded as `source_particle - destination_particle`, which reduces the complexity of entering data (compared to triples, commonly used in modern knowledge graph applications). Cyberlinks combined with markdown marked up text files, where various conventions on connections between particles could be used, provide the necessary flexibility to Bostrom's knowledge graph, adapting it to a vast variety of possible usages.
