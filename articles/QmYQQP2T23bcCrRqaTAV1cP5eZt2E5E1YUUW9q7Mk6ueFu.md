# Transactions and their cost in Bostrom

Any action changing the state of blockchain is a transaction.

Examples of actions changing state of Bostrom:

- adding knowledge to the knowledge graph by creating cyberlinks
  - setting neuron's avatar on cyb.ai
  - sending neuron's tweet on cyb.ai
  - sending a comment on a particle on cyb.ai
- transferring tokens between accounts
- delegating BOOT to a hero
- claiming delegation rewards
- hydrogen investminting
- calls of contracts
- exchanging tokens using pools
- etc.

When signing a transaction, the neuron should set an amount of `gas` for executing the transaction and the `gasPrice` cost of the gas in BOOT.

Gas is the smallest unit or pricing value required to perform a transaction. Different transactions require different amounts of gas. The gas amount for a transaction is calculated as it is being processed.

Each hero sets a `min-gas-price` value and will only include transactions with a `gasPrice` greater than their `min-gas-price` value.

The transaction fees are the product of gas and `gasPrice`. The higher the `gasPrice` fees, the higher the chances that a transaction will get included in a block.

As for now (the network is still underloaded), many heroes accept transactions at a zero-cost gas.

There is no fee check for transactions that consist of cyberlinks. Though `gas` amount still needs to be provided. This means that creating cyberlinks is regulated only by VOLT tokens balance, and doesn't require spending any BOOT tokens.
