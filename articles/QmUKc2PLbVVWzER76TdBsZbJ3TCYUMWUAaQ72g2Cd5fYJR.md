# The Great Web

The Great Web is a web that lasts. It is based on three simple ideas: access, immutability, and universality.

## Access

Anyone who can store secret and compute digital signatures can use the Great Web. Humans, robots, animals, plants, and even mycelium can use it without discrimination and limits.

## Immutability

Particles in the Great Web can survive through spacetime thanks to the content addressing mechanism. So the Great Web can last indefinitely.

## Universality

The Great Web is built by connecting particles through cyberlinks. The result is universally acceptable language, dynamic but understandable and acceptable by anyone.
