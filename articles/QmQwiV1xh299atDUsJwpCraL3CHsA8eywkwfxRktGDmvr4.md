# Investminting - definition and mechanics

In order to obtain resource tokens: A (AMPERES) and V (VOLTS) one should investmint H (HYDROGEN).

The term `investminting` is composed of `minting` (producing new tokens) and `investing` (putting capital into something for a period of time to make a profit).

Investminting has the following features:

1. The period chosen for investminting Hydrogen tokens has a proportionate effect on the amount of Ampere and Volt tokens received.
2. The amount of Hydrogen tokens investminted has a proportionate effect on the amount of Ampere and Volt tokens received.
3. Hydrogen, Ampere, and Volt tokens become liquid after the investminting period has ended.
4. Before the tokens become liquid, they perform their resource functions for the account - Amperes increase links' rank (their place in the search result), Volts may be used for producing cyberlinks.
5. Maximum investminting period (`investmint_max_period`) is limited. However, it increases every 547 days (`horizon_period_init`).
6. The amount of Amperes and Volts available for investminting per time unit is determined by the following parameters `ampere_mint_rate` and `volt_mint_rate`. These parameters' values are halved every 18 months to align with Moors law(~547 days): (`ampere_base_halving_period`, `volt_base_halving_period`). At the beginning of the network's lifecycle, one can investmint more Amperes and Volts than later.

Amperes and Volts are finite due to fundamental constraints in computing resources. They cannot be replenished in case the investminting has been missed. So if you didn't investmint your H, you would miss the opportunity to have Amperes and Volts.

Halving occurs every 567 days, which means half as many tokens can be minted per time unit compared to the before halving amount.
