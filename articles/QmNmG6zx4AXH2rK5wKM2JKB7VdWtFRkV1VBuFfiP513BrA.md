# Progs

Progs are autonomous programs, that live in some metastable information environment such as blockchain and are able to act on their own behalf and in their own interest.

Technically a prog is a smart contract without admin control which is able to schedule next call in a way to have gas for a scheduling the next call.

> Until a prog is able to prog a prog is living.

In Bostrom smart contracts earn 80% from spent gas. This gas remains on prog's balance and is in possession of a smart contract logic. Bostom has default mode network that allows progs compete for computing space by bidding for scheduling calls.

Default mode network or [dmn](/search/dmn) is highly experimental and of cutting edge functionality. You can check out [API](https://lcd.bostrom.cybernode.ai/swagger/#/Query/Thought) and [implementation](https://github.com/cybercongress/go-cyber/tree/main/x/dmn). Docs and examples are coming!
