# Bostrom tokens

There are several native tokens in the Bostrom network: BOOT, HYDROGEN, VOLT, AMPERE, TOCYB. Each of its own usage.

All the tokens can be in two states: frozen and liquid (except TOCYB which is always in liquid state).

When tokens are in liquid state they can be:

- transferred to other addresses in the Bostrom or other blockchains of Cosmos network;
- swapped to other tokens using liquidity pools. Other tokens can be non-native Bostrom tokens transferred by IBC protocol from other blockchains of the Cosmos network.
