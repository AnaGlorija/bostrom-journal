# Bostrom is a full refactoring of the Euler network

Bostrom blockchain is the result of 5 years' work and research of [cyber~congress](https://github.com/cybercongress/) team.

Before Bostrom network (which itself had 5 testnets), there were 6 testnets known as Euler network.

Bostrom is a full refactoring of the Euler network with a strong focus on Superintelligence. It includes a new distribution model, economics, improved ranking, and some superintelligent abilities.

Founders perceive Bostrom as a canary network in the same way that Kusama relates to Polkadot. The Bostrom knowledge graph tends to be a bootstrap hub for domain-specific networks of Cyber. The network works as a testbed for Interplanetary Knowlege Protocol communications and different experiments, including Moon development. Consider Bostrom a network with high risks but of market value.

The key differences within the Bostrom and Cyber network are to be discussed [here](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom%20vs%20cyber). The launch of the Bostrom network is the inception of an ecosystem.
