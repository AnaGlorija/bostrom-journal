### Introduction

In this issue we collected particles from the founding team and the first users of Bostrom regarding using Bostrom. Those particles could have been edited to correct typos and grammar mistakes, to delete repeated information already presented in other journal articles and to make them as a whole more readable. Initial particle references are provided. >>|

### About the journal

This journal is a new phenomenon. We experiment here with Bostrom's unique features and apply them to real world problems in a form resembling modern scientific journals.

Bostrom journal is created on top of the Bostrom Blockchain knowledge rank.

Bostrom journal is created to be easily parsable to enable users to use it as a knowledge graph (the subgraph of the main graph), and for convenience of reading.

We assembled this journal from particles. >>|

### Journal's standard formatting markup and tags

All the particles were formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), an opinionated code formatter.

- `##` chapter names start with 2 hashes
- `###` 3 and more hashes are used in particles (it means that number of hashes from the original particle is changed respectively)
- `==>` symbol marks the line with service tags. 2 lines below the symbol begins the text content of a particle.
- `[cid]` - cid tag of the original particle
- `[author]` - the tag with url to the author of the original particle
- `>>|` - marks the end of the particle
- `---` - 3 minuses are used to create space between particles (as otherwise Prettier will delete this space and make the text more dense)
- `-|` and `|-` - indicate the beginning and the end of the editorial note that was not originally a part of the particle>>|

### Journal's design open questions

Should there be a link to the edited particle? Should it replace the original link or should both links be present? Should we provide a describtion of alterations to highlight and clarify differences between the old and the new particle? >>|

### Capabilities of the Bostrom Blockchain

- new way of sharing, storing, ranking, and searching for information;
- platform for building on top of these ☝;
- social platform;
- economic environment;
- ground for AI;
- and much more that can be imagined and done.

Site [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai) is an application built using the Bostrom Blockchain.

On [cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai) you can already create [cyberlinks](https://cyb.ai/search/cyberlink), search the [graph](https://cyb.ai/oracle), rank using the [Relevance machine](https://cyb.ai/search/rm), share and store information, [earn rewards](https://cyb.ai/halloffame), [investmint](https://cyb.ai/mint), and [tweet](https://cyb.ai/search/tweet). [Bostrom](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom) is the [bootloader](https://cyb.ai/bootloader) for [Cyber](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber), with the same features. >>|

### Purpose of the Bostrom network

Bostrom allows adding knowledge to the knowledge graph verifiably. By "verifiably" we mean that it is guaranteed by blockchain design that a particular address added specific content into the blockchain at the known time.

The knowledge graph is a directed weighted graph between CIDs (Content-ID of files, also known as content addresses, IPFS-hashes, IPFS-links).

Cyberlinks are the edges of the knowledge graph, CIDs are the vertexes (aka nodes).

In order to create cyberlinks in Bostrom, user accounts (so-called neurons) must have VOLT and AMPERE tokens.

By definition, created cyberlinks cannot be deleted. This means, among other things, that they will always be taken into account in cyberrank (until "forgetting" or "pruning" functions are introduced). >>|

### Superintelligence

The term superintelligence was introduced by the modern philosopher Nick Bostrom (the blockchain Bostrom is named after him). Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest".

We expect that the knowledge graph of Bostrom blockchain can become the knowledge provider to superintelligence machines. >>|

### IPFS, Content-addressing mechanism

IPFS (interplanetary file system) is a distributed (decentralized) file system within which files are stored on network members' computers. Files are received by their CID (cryptographic hash) using software that supports IPFS protocol.

Files are downloaded from network participants' nodes. Therefore, the more devices have the file, the higher chances it can be downloaded (and potentially faster).

IPFS does not guarantee the safety or accessibility of the files. >>|

### Bostrom is a full refactoring of the Euler network

Bostrom is a full refactoring of the Euler network with a strong focus on Superintelligence. It includes a new distribution model, economics, improved ranking, and some superintelligent abilities. We perceive [Bostrom](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom) as a canary network in the same way that Kusama relates to Polkadot. The Bostrom knowledge graph tends to be a bootstrap hub for domain-specific networks of Cyber. The network works as a testbed for Interplanetary Knowlege Protocol communications and different experiments. Consider Bostrom a network with high risks but of market value. The key differences within the Cyber network are being discussed [here](https://cyb.ai/search/bostrom%20vs%20cyber). The launch of the Bostrom network is the inception of an ecosystem. >>|

### Bootloader meaning

A bootloader, also known as a boot program or bootstrap loader, is a special operating system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. For this purpose, immediately after a device starts, a bootloader is generally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. The boot medium receives information from the computer’s firmware (e.g. BIOS) about where the bootloader is. The whole process is also described as “booting”.

A summary of a bootloader’s functions:

Bootloaders serve as a mediator between hardware and the operating system. As soon as a bootloader has been initialized by the respective firmware, it has system responsibility to get the boot process going. The first task is to load the main memory, which is essential for the processor to work.

In the second step, the bootloader loads the kernel of the operating system, that is, the primary component of the system software that controls all storage and processor permissions and contains all important drivers. The bootstrap loader also processes different routine tasks and commands, e.g. integrating data storage. Some bootloaders also perform tasks beyond starting up software, including:

- identifying and starting other available bootloaders;
- launching application programs (frequently used in the 1980s to launch computer games directly from a disk);
- correcting or expanding missing functions and entries in the firmware;
- loading alternative firmware.

After successfully completing all tasks, the bootloader returns the system responsibility to the kernel.>>|

### Get Bostrom address{>>Нам бы сюда прикрутить ссылки на видосы. > Ага, надо<<}

First of all, you need a Bostrom address. For that, you need a Keplr extension.

1. Download [extension for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap)

2. Setup Keplr
3. Go to [My robot](https://cyb.ai/) to connect your Keplr wallet. >>|

### Bostrom: How to start and navigate step by step

Initially, it might seem complex but as you dwell in it there is lots of fun exploring the whole process step by step. Obviously, I myself have just started this exploration and there is a lot for me to discover. Saying that, if you are a first-time cyb.ai-er, start with the below:

1. Buy BOOT on osmosis dex (OSMO is not available on any CEX, only ATOM is available on CEX. Transfer ATOM and convert it to BOOT on OSMO).
   https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=OSMO&to=BOOT
2. Once you have BOOT in your account (Keplr Wallet) stake it. This will give you Hydrogen tokens.
3. Go to https://cyb.ai/, connect your Keplr Wallet.
4. You have to mint Volt and Ampere tokens by freezing liquid Hydrogen tokens. Minting is available via the following link https://cyb.ai/mint. A low number of frozen Hydrogen tokens might not get you any Volt and Ampere tokens. Adjust the Hydrogen and the frozen (number of days) bars so that a number greater than zero appears above. It indicates the quantity of Volt or Ampere tokens you will get. The 'Investmint' button is active only when the number of Volt or Ampere tokens is not equal to zero. Click on the Investmint button to mint Volt and Ampere tokens.
5. Once you have Volt and Ampere tokens your energy bar will be charging. You need energy to perform different activities such as adding avatar, tweeting etc...
6. As a first task add your avatar by clicking on 'My robot' and then clicking on the box suggesting adding an avatar (at the bottom you will see a box enabled to upload the image). Once the image is added you will be asked to publish your first tweet.
7. When both your avatar and your first tweet are published you will gain some Karma. (click on the avatar link to check it).>>|

## Knowledge graph

---

Cyber knowledge graph is comprised of particles and cyberlinks between them. The Graph (as well as any subgraph) is created and augmented by neurons while creating new cyberlinks. The definitions and the mechanism are described below.{>>Может добавим картинку? > Какую?<<}

### Cyberlinks

Cyberlink is a noun and a verb.

A cyberlink is the link in Cyber between two particles registered in Bostrom blockchain.

To cyberlink - to create a cyberlink between two particles. >>|

### Relevance machine

You can cyberlink any pieces of information to each other. You can search on cyber or add content yourself. To start cyberlinking you need Amperes and Volts, which you can get by [investminting H](https://cyb.ai/mint) in [HFR](https://cyb.ai/search/hfr), or you can buy Hydrogen in [Teleport](https://cyb.ai/teleport).

- For more information use Cyber to search for [cyberlink](https://cyb.ai/search/cyberlink) >>|

### Bostrom tokens

There are several tokens in the Bostrom network: BOOT, HYDROGEN, VOLT, AMPERE. Each of its own usage.

BOOT is the main token of Bostrom. The token's name BOOT symbolizes the BOOTloader nature of the Bostrom network for the future Cyber network.

With BOOT one can:

- `hire a hero` (to stake or to delegate tokens to a validator), being paid rewards in return (risk fee);
  - for each staked BOOT a HYDROGEN is minted (with a 1 to 1 ratio)
- transfer to somebody (if BOOT is in a liquid state);
- pay for network transactions (pay for gas). Though now, many validators accept transactions for free;
- vote for protocol change and public goods.

With HYDROGEN one can:

- `investmint` HYDROGEN for a limited period of time to produce VOLT and AMPERE tokens;
- exchange back for delegated BOOT in order to transfer BOOT into a liquid state;
- transfer to someone (if in liquid state).

VOLT, AMPERE:

- are needed to create cyberlinks, to train Bostrom;
- may be transferred.>>|

### Investminting - definition and mechanics

In order to obtain resource tokens: A (AMPERES) and V (VOLTS) one should investmint H (HYDROGEN). The term `investminting` is composed of `minting` (producing new tokens) and `investing` (putting capital into something for a period of time in order to make a profit).

After Hydrogen tokens are investminted, the neurons balance is replenished by a number of temporary `frozen` for transferring but ready to use A and V tokens. Both tokens of the investminting pair (H and A or V) are `frozen` till the end of the investminting period.

#### Meaning of Volt and Ampere tokens

Each Volt token on the neuron's balance allows to create 1 cyberlink per day. The ability to create cyberlinks is restored within a day.

If the network is underloaded, one can produce more cyberlinks (up to 4 cyberlinks for each Volt on balance per day).

The more Ampere tokens the neuron has, the higher his cyberlinks would be ranked. Cyberrank is recalculated for each `cycle` so that the changes in the amount of Amperes tokens on the neurons' balances that produced cyberlinks would influence the cyberrank of the whole graph.

#### Investminting rules

The following rules apply to investminting:

1. The period chosen for investminting Hydrogen tokens has a proportionate effect on the amount of Ampere and Volt tokens received.
2. The amount of Hydrogen tokens investminted has a proportionate effect on the amount of Ampere and Volt tokens received.
3. H, Ampere, and Volt tokens become liquid after the investminting period has ended.
4. Before the tokens become liquid, they perform their resource functions for the account - Amperes increase links' rank (their place in the search result), Volts may be used for producing cyberlinks.
5. Maximum investminting period (`investmint_max_period`) is limited. However, it increases every 547 days (`horizon_period_init`).
6. The amount of Amperes and Volts available for investminting per time unit is determined by the following parameters `ampere_mint_rate` and `volt_mint_rate`. These parameters' values are halved every 18 months to align with Moors law(~547 days). (`ampere_base_halving_period`, `volt_base_halving_period`). At the beginning of the network's lifecycle, one can investmint more Amperes and Volts than later.

Amperes and Volts are finite due to fundamental constraints in computing resources. They cannot be replenished in case the investminting has been missed. So if you didn't investmint your H, you would miss the opportunity to have Amperes and Volts.

Halving occurs every 567 days, which means half as many tokens can be minted per time unit compared to the before halving amount. >>|

### CYB token

CYB token is a token of [Cyber](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber). Everyone who have [TOCYB](https://cyb.ai/token/TOCYB) will be able to convert it into CYB tokens through private exodus. The contract will be developed by [cyber~Congress](https://cyb.ai/search/cybercongress) >>|

### The transaction cost in Bostrom

Any action in a blockchain is a transaction. Each transaction has a cost. That cost is covered by an agent conducting the transaction.

Examples of actions in Bostrom:

- creating cyberlinks
  - setting neuron's avatar on cyb.ai
  - sending neuron's tweet on cyb.ai
  - sending a comment on a particle on cyb.ai
- transferring tokens between accounts
- delegating BOOT to a hero
- claiming delegation rewards
- hydrogen investminting
- exchanging tokens using pools
- etc

When signing a transaction, the neuron should set an amount of gas for executing the transaction and the cost of the gas in BOOT. In case of a large number of transactions (high network load), heroes may set their servers to accept those transactions of higher fee with higher priority. As for now (the network is still underloaded), many heroes accept transactions at a zero-cost gas. >>|

### Stacking mechanism - encouraging desired behavior in agents (heroes and neurons)

Bostrom is a proof-of-stake blockchain. Validators ensure proof-of-stake blockchain functioning. A validator (the hero in Bostrom terminology) is a server with installed blockchain software (node).

Each node contains a blockchain replica (transaction log) that allows computing the total state into each block (e.g. accounts balance). Nodes agree among themselves on a common state of affairs according to the Tendermint consensus protocol as a guideline.

Bostrom is designed to economically encourage (incentivize) heroes and neurons to perform useful functions for the system.

#### Valuable functions of Bostrom's agents (Heroes and Neurons)

Heroes' valuable functions are:

- computing each blockchain block;
- checking and signing transaction messages from other nodes (thus reaching a consensus on the present state of the blockchain);
- distributing state of a blockchain to applications and consumers.

Neurons' useful functions are:

- maintaining desired balance between `staked` and `liquid` tokens (`goal_bonded` parameter in the senate which is `80%` at the moment of writing);
- distributing `staked` tokens to validators who perform their functions properly thus preventing `slashing`;
- using H token (HYDROGEN), which can be obtained in exchange for a `staked` BOOT, for investminting Ampere and Volt tokens (and then using As and Vs for creating сyberlinks, i.e. training Bostrom);
- deciding on the evolution of the network using the governance portal (`senate`).

#### The economic incentivization mechanism of agents in Bostrom

The economic incentivization mechanism of heroes and neurons in Bostrom includes rewards and penalties.

Blockchain is programmed to mint new BOOT tokens in each block to pay rewards. The `inflation_rate` coefficient determines the amount of new tokens to be produced. `Inflation_rate` coefficient depends on the share of `staked` BOOTs:

- if the `staked` percentage of BOOTs is less than the `goal_bonded` parameter, then the `inflation_rate` coefficient will be increasing for each block till it hits the `inflation_rate_max` value. The higher the `inflation_rate`, the more rewarding is the `stake`;
- if the `staked` percentage of BOOTs is more than the `goal_bonded` parameter, then the `inflation_rate` coefficient will be decreasing for each block till it hits the `inflation_rate_min` value, thus signaling to search for another way of profiting from BOOTs

New tokens are distributed between neurons who `staked` their tokens and heroes proportionally to their `staked` tokens.

Heroes receive a set fee.

Neurons are rewarded for deligating (`staking`) tokens to heroes and bearing `slashing` risks (reducing `stake` by the penalty amount), and also risks of skipping blocks without getting any rewards (while the hero commited violation remains in the `jail` state).

Neurons' risks are that the heroes, to whom the former have delegated their tokens, may commit a violation of two kinds:

- Downtime (skipping new blocks computing).
- Double sign (using the same private key of validator on two diffrenet servers).

`slashing` is a feedback mechanism from the blockchain to heroes, as it forces neurons to redistribute their `stakes` in favor of heroes, who perform their functions properly.

When a particular hero is caught violating rules, that hero is put into the `jail` state, which means no rewards are produced for the tokens deligated to him.

All the violations and the penalties are noted in the blockchain settings and are executed according to the Tenderimnt consensus protocol.

As of now (2022-01-14), there is no publicly available services for monitoring heroes' violation statistics. Therefore neurons have to make decisions based only on their own statistics. In order to make it easier to track heroes’ performance, one can use a hack: if only multiples of 10 are deligated to heroes' balances, `slashing` is easily tracked in case it did occur.

For example, we can delegate `153 298 189` BOOTs to a hero. In this case we'll have to remember the exact amount deligated and constantly recheck for potential changes. It can become problematic as one bonds to more heroes. On the other hand, we can delegate `153 000 000` making the violation easily traceable. Simply browse through your stakes and any non-zero digit at the end will give away the violating hero.

In order to hedge `slashing` risks one may distribute `stakes` between several heroes. >>|

### Cyb.ai: intro, mechanics

[Cyb.ai](https://cyb.ai) - is a WEB interface to the Bostrom blockchain developed by the Bostrom team. Among Cyb.ai's many functions are:

- receiving data on cyberlinks recorded by Bostrom blockchain from an intermediate database;
- sending transactions to Bostrom when cyberlinks are created (and signed by a particular address in keplr extension);
- receiving and sharing objects in the IPFS network using library [ipfs-js](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs).

There is a search bar in cyb.ai. When a user enters a query in the search bar cyb.ai computes the ipfs hash of a text file with the search query contents. After that, cyb.ai queries the database where data on cyberlinks recorded in Bostrom is replicated. If there are cyberlinks originating from the search query's IPFS hash, then the database returns hashes of output files sorted by cyberrank and cyb.ai presents these results.

Thus, the search results in cyb.ai are the files stored in IPFS (received by the browser and rendered on the page) with the IPFS hashes that were cyberlinked to the IPFS hash of the text entered into the search bar.

If no cyberlinks are created for a text file hash of a particular search query, the cyb.ai displays particles linked to a text file hash with "0" contents in the search result.

Account avatar is an image file in IPFS. The hash of the image file is cyberlinked by a text file "avatar"'s hash by the current neuron.

Amperes message in a particular Twitter account's feed is a cyberlink between the text "tweet" and the IPFS hash of the message file. >>|

#### Bostrom's Governance

Governance process of [Cyber networks](https://cyb.ai/search/computing%20knowledge) is focused on the [evolution](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20evolution) of its code and is based on 3 methods:

- [self-reflection](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20self-reflection)
- [investments](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20investments)
- [adaptation](https://cyb.ai/search/cyber%20adaptation)

Everyone can submit proposals.

A proposal can become active if [minimum deposit](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov) is submitted by network participants in the [max deposit period](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov).

During [voting period](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov) proposal have to reach [quorum](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/parameters/gov). The threshold is defined as the minimum proportion of Yes votes excluding Abstain votes for the proposal to be accepted. More details in [cosmos-sdk docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/gov/). >>|

### The Great Web

The Great Web is a web that lasts. It is based on three simple ideas: access, immutability, universality.

#### Access

Anyone who can store secret and compute digital signatures can use the Great Web. Humans, robots, animals, plants, and even mycelium can use it without discrimination and limits.

#### Immutability

Particles in the Great Web can survive through spacetime thanks to content addressing mechanism. So the Great Web can last indefinitely.

#### Universality

The Great Web is built by connecting particles through cyberlinks. The result is universally acceptable language, dynamic but understandable and acceptable by anyone. >>|

### Markdown

The content of text particles is rendered in Markdown. Cyb.ai uses these JS packages to render markdown: [ReactMarkdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown), [remarkGfm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-gfm).

Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

If you want your posts look beautiful, use [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [test it here](https://markdown-it.github.io/) before posting. >>|

### Particle "0" - the default answer to unnkown queries

This text can be seen on [Cyber Results Page](https://cyb.ai/search/Cyber%20Results%20Page) ([CRP](https://cyb.ai/search/CRP)). Cyber Results Page contains a number of particles, which are the destination of [cyberlinks](https://cyb.ai/search/cyberlink) from your query.

This text is a [Particle](https://cyb.ai/search/particle) (in terms of Cyber). Particle is a file that has an IPFS hash and that somebody has on his device with IPFS software installed, so other users can download this file using IPFS protocol.

CRP renders the content of such files, so [Neurons](https://cyb.ai/search/neuron) (the users like you in terms of Cyber) can see it right in their browser.

Nobody created cyberlinks for the query you entered (or you just followed some link on CRP with an already defined query). And you see this text, which is cyberlinked to the query "[0](https://cyb.ai/search/0)". Cyber has created those queries with no cyberlinks display results from the query "[0](https://cyb.ai/search/0)".

Btw, you can create relevant cyberlinks to your initial query, "[0](https://cyb.ai/search/0)" query, or any other query. Cyber is fantastic. Everything in cyber is hardcore and geeky but beautiful and powerful. Use your opportunity to explore the ways of using cyber. >>|

### cyberGift

The purpose of this research is to inspire at least 100k power-users of web3 to join the force of learning Superintelligence. To achieve this, we are going to gift 70% of the Bostrom genesis tokens BOOT to agents of Ethereum and Cosmos who are capable of contributing their best to the quality of the knowledge graph. First, we start by highlighting key audiences for establishing network effects and tackling basic chicken and eggs situation. Next, we balance out the participation of key actors by splitting them into grades and adjusting allocations within the groups. Then we apply a filter in order to remove toxic fiat brains from the collective thought process. Finally, we add a crucial incentive to hurry up.

The research results are represented by reproducible scripts that output addresses and balances which will be loaded to the claim CosmWasm contract after the launch of Bostrom.

Data source is [BigQuery crypto-ethereum dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?d=crypto_ethereum&p=bigquery-public-data&page=dataset&project=cosmic-keep-223223) by [Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/blockchain-etl).

Research is done on the [proposal](https://cyber.page/governance/20) basis. We hope this research can help pioneer a new wave of thinking in decentralized marketing.

#### Connecting the Dots

The biggest problem in bootstrapping a blockchain ecosystem from scratch is that it is not enough to attract just users. Established network effects exist between four key groups: users, investors, validators, developers.

![Network effects](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmf2ARvyZ1gu5HJmsPjnWQdhyfmvaEVxnz9vvp5KUt3Lgo)

Hence we have to understand how to attract all these guys simultaneously in order to target healthy organic growth.

In our case that would not be enough. Firstly, Cyber is a content-oriented project. We need to understand how to add content creators to the soup. Secondly, information on the project has to be propagated somehow to all these guys, so key opinion leaders have to be incentivized. Thirdly, as the Cyber project heavily relies on the interchain idea we have to attract the community behind IBC technology. We also want to add some fun giving the power to the guys behind weird cyberpunk ideas. Finally, we want to check the credibility of the most trusted liquidity hubs.

#### Distribution between Grades

An amount of distributed BOOT tokens should be equal for each grade within an audience. The amount of addresses should also be divided into grades for each audience as

![Distribution between grades](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWcyKgUAqtbubrmXyrP8ufXLmLoWMksF32ZzdGRYvCa3b)

{++-|Cyber ecosystem consists of a number of different audiences. They are divided depending on their backgrounds and roles played in the community. Main audiences and their short characteristics are listed below.|-++}

#### Average Citizens

- ETH owners and senders of outgoing transactions

#### Masters of the Great Web

- ERC721 owners and creators of contracts using factories

#### Astronauts

- ATOM owners
- OSMO owners and liquidity providers
- LUNA owners

#### Extraordinary Hackers

- contract creators

#### Heroes of the Great Web

- participants of Genesis and ETH 2.0 stackers

#### Passionate Investors

- owners of the selected ERC20 tokens

#### Key Opinion Leaders

- TOP holders by the selected ERC20 tokens

#### Cyberpunks

- owners of the cyberpunk tokens

#### Leeches

- manual assigned addresses of top CEXes

These audiences were highlighted because their participation is necessary to form a full-fledged ecosystem of the project.

#### Audience Rules

The initial conditions for the allocation of classes were selected based on the analysis of web3 user activity and the need to cover the most web3 power-users. All distribution rules between grades are calculated in the respective jupyter notebooks.

| Audience                 | Rule                                                                           | Grade 1    | Grade 2     | Grade 3                         | Calculations(Jupyter notebooks)                                                                                       |

#### Distribution between Audiences

Based on counting the number of addresses and determining the fair reward of the participants of each audience, the following balanced distribution between them is proposed:

![Distribution between Audiences](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmS5z9wW53Rj7sUxb8mJsnp5JqFrUzHRhhwBvJ6YZjc2Yk)

When an address hits multiple audiences, its reward is cumulative.

#### Excluding Fiat Brains

Addresses based on the fiat system will not be included, namely those that satisfy these two conditions:

1. Stablecoin balance is more than sum of ETH and [selected ERC20 tokens](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybergift/blob/main/erc20__investors_and_cyberpunks.ipynb) balances.
2. Stablecoin balance is more than 0.1 ETH.

#### Prize to be the First

We've added an incentive to claim gift early. There are about `4M` addresses in Gift, but at the same time we expect that only the first `1/10` accounts can claim them.

There will be incentive `13x` for those who claim first reducing to `7x` who came last.

### Result Validation

My name is Maxim Razhev (@ninjascant). I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of experience in blockchain analytics development. I made a manual re-check of queries used here e.g.

- re-calculating balances on a subset of wallets and comparing with a node output;
- comparing the list of NFTs and other entities with open sources like Etherscan and OpenSea;
- verifying that the data presented in the final tables are consistent with query logic.

So, by making this commit, I confirm that the results of the analysis presented in this repository are checked by me and correct. >>|

### Warp Investment Engine

Liquidity incentives subsidized by [Senate](https://cyb.ai/senate) are a powerful investment tool for bootstrapping the ecosystem. Let's call it Warp Investment Engine. It's certainly more powerful than direct investments from Senate because WIE spreads investment across project participators depending on their risk appetite.

In this post, I will discuss a simple and efficient approach that is available for our community today, thanks to CosmWasm. I am sure that more efficient solutions exist, such as [conviction voting](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmYEzUJKBkJ8c155jWmPmPAkspYGAFvCRF9jVWythVgGpx). But I don't think it's the most reliable and fastest solution at the moment.

I am convinced that the Osmosis example is the best industry case of how that could be done. But a lot can be improved:

1. Lack of transparency. Props are not executed. Props are signals. So everything ends up with a spreadsheet. One of the cyber~Congress values is automation. So we can improve that.
2. The scheme is quite fixed. An update of the scheme requires consensus change. In Bostrom, the scheme will be based on CosmWasm contracts. So community pool will allocate tokens directly to the contract
3. Currently, gas consumption of Osmosis incentives is suboptimal and not flexible. It is certainly possible to be more gas efficient.
4. LPs are not immediately withdrawable. We are thinking about a more flexible scheme which Ampleforth has proved. The idea is to offer more incentives that hold liquidity tokens longer. But in our case, the incentive will be not grade based but curve based.
5. The entire process of listing tokens has to be completely permissionless, so any community can push some buttons to make the token depositable, deploy an instance of incentive contract and draw a prop.

### Rewarding scheme

We start from the idea that any amount of tokens can be sent to contract by the Senate, Dao, or any neuron. So the contract has to compute all rewards based only on the available for itself balance.

Here we have to ask the question of whether incentives have to be bounded in time or can last indefinitely? I propose to focus on bounded in time incentives due to the following reasons:

1. Technically easier to implement
2. Cheaper to compute
3. Capital efficiency. Incentives in the long tail will not be significant for decision-making, and some capital will be stuck in immortal contracts.

The next question is whether or not incentive contracts have to support multiple tokens. As we want to have a simple and composable scheme, we decide to stick to a principle of one contract, one token. In our design of consensus computer, we already have at least two types of tokens: native and cw. Multiple tokens make logic significantly more complex.

The important thing is to make the curve parametrizable so incentives can be spread in time depending on the use case.

And finally, we want our incentive contract to mint liquid token of the incentive pool so the capital can be reused further.

So we came to an understanding of the main input parameters for a contract factory:

- pool token
- expiration time
- reward token
- name of the farming token

### Rewarding Formula

    LP Reward =
      Contract balance *
      Amount of farming tokens *
      Reward coefficient defined by supplied curve and amount of time >>|

### Looking for cyb magicians

It's time to extend Cyb team. Our small prototype [grew to ~100 clocs](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb). Its been written by only one cyber~Congress member Dima Korzhovnik. It's a crazy effort. We were trying to put as many features as fast as possible. Of course, this leads to a situation when adding new features causes progressively more bugs. So I am going to start the decomposition of the project. The following magicians are needed:

#### Architect

Currently, we have to rewrite Cyb completely. Some parts of the code can be optimized, and some parts have to be moved on the graph. And some must be added as the purpose of Cyb is to become web os with access permissions, resource control, and network manager. My personal challenge is to make it a compact and composable 5 clocs piece of software that will upload its code from ipfs on demand.

#### Designer

We have our personal ux lib - [gravity](https://github.com/cybercongress/gravity). While the idea is shining, the library is not. I want to find a dedicated engineer who will be able to boost it with a deep understanding of the power of knowledge graph.

#### Parser

The purpose is to create parsing library which will allow to parse web2 pages and cyberlink them. The lib must become the source of transformation.

#### Librarian

cyber-js lib is critical for the adoption of the cyber protocol across web developers. We have to make this experience as smooth as possible. Also, this lib will lay the foundation for other language libs coordination of which will also be the responsibility of the librarian.

#### Tester

The purpose of the tester is to embed test-driven development in the process of engineering. In fact, this hero must be able to understand the project so deeply so he can always be ahead of development. But the good start is to write plain simple tests for the most critical scenarios.

#### What is vital to joining the team?

- Alignment with cyber values and vision
- Understanding of blockchain industry
- Professional geekiness

I am going to reward those who recommend successful magicians with 10 GBOOT. Contact me in [Status](https://status.im/). I am `mastercyb.eth` there. >>|

### Bostroms - Leading behavioral science in blockchain

Friends! Probably not all of you know that our project is the leader in behavioral analysis in the blockchain industry.

Cohort analysis of funnels is the basis of behavioral analytics widely used in the internet business, but for unknown reasons, this data is entirely inaccessible for public blockchain networks.

It allows you to understand with surgical precision how citizens behave and, most importantly, to understand what changes in the software lead to.

Here you can see how citizens were acquired:

![acquisition-analysis](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSquMMXKJso46NN8NzcSvcsPbHZhNWNbCMFvNNZxds9iz)

Here you can see how deeply citizens arrived in a different week used the blockchain:

![cohort-analysis](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUnpQFhi5cXPqqhXB97njnt3gyqgBsmh36cRrk4HPt1uK)

This information allows us to better understand our collaborative behavior, provide better feedback to a high-level organism, and improve our decision-making.

### Urbit + Cyber

In our [white paper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ1Vong13MDNxixDyUdjniqqEj8sjuNEBYMyhQU4gQgq3) cyber~Congress allocates 1% of the total CYB supply to the [Urbit](https://urbit.org/) community - because Urbit is awesome. However, if you are familiar with Urbit, you know its not a trivial project. Hence, I would like to propose the steps for gifting Urbit with CYB tokens.|

UPDATE: As promised in our WP, we have gifted the Urbit aliens with 1% of the supply. To check the balance of your gift, simply follow the ~white rabbit~ [link](https://cyber.page/search/0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc454e4438f44e), and swap the address for your own to see if you were lucky (use the ETH address that held the planet/star/galaxy).

#### Milestones

1. Write this proposition
2. Review this proposition
3. Include drop and grant overview (please see below)
4. Write an email to Urbit disclosing our plans
5. Propose a grant for hacking cyber~Urbit app
6. Propose the ways to get this info to the Urbit community

#### But why Urbit

Urbit is awesome. Urbit is the last frontier of the Great Web. It is THE new computer science. A new, written from scratch, tech-stack that completely changes the game. We believe in Urbit (not less than we believe in ourselves - that's a lot. Really).

We share Urbits values. It is utterly silly to believe in decentralization without Urbit. If cyber is the last answering and relevance machine you'll ever need, then Urbit is the last computer you'll ever need.

For any further information [please visit here](https://urbit.org/docs/).

#### The Gift

We need to gather information about Urbit addresses to gift Urbit. We propose to divide the 1% (which is 10 TCYB or ten trillion CYB) into 3 categories: 30% to galaxies, 30% to stars and 40% to planets.

Hence, here are the steps that we propose to follow:

- Parse the Ethereum blockchain for Azimuth points and gather all addresses that own a piece of Urbit;
- Count the % in the stake as per the above information;
- Convert the ETH addresses to Cyber addresses (extracting and converting the pub. keys);
- Include this information in Cybers' Genesis block.

This will give anyone owing Azimuth points the possibility to securely import their ETH private key into Cyber and claim CYB tokens. No need to disclose Urbits master key at any point.

#### The Grant

Urbit has a cool open-source [grant program](https://grants.urbit.org/). What we want to achieve is to create a cyber~Urbit app, which will essentially create a connection between Urbit and Cyber. At a very basic version, it should allow someone to:

- View their balance
- Manage their keys
- Send and receive CYB tokens (sign transactions)
- Allow remote procedure calls, such as viewing block info
- Create cyberlinks (please see our paper)
- Be able to upload an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) hash from Urbit

Our inspiration comes from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-TjZfMLqOc).

At a more advanced stage, I would imagine the wrapper can control a cyber~Node from an Urbit, I mean - participate in validating blocks. Wrap any other calls that will be available. At a very later stage - participate in all of the governance modules of Cyber.

The grant system at Urbit is usually funded by Tlon, the company that develops Urbit. We propose to fund the project ourselves (if Tlon decides to add to our funding, we will be glad, as we believe that our idea benefits both projects) with the following:

- A liquid payment of 1500$ in ETH to the day of payment (to be payed out upon completion of the task);
- A stake in Cyber in CYB Tokens equals to: 1.5 GCYB (to be payed out after the launch of the mainnet).

The proposal should and will include:

- A short background story, explaining what is needed to be created, referencing to this post;
- A description of what the cyber~Urbit app should look like;
- A resource guide (links to necessary documentation);
- Contribution guidelines;
- The size of the proposed bounty.

We assume that the work on such a solution should take between 1 - 3 weeks. The hack should be:

- 100% open-source
- Should be submitted as a PR into a separate repo on our GitHub
- Should be reviewed by Tlon

#### Why would this be beneficial to both projects

I think the benefit to Cyber is obvious, hence there is no need to describe it (however it is pretty much similar to Urbits benefit). Our vision and reasons behind this can be found in the above part of this document "But why Urbit".

To our belief Urbit will benefit in the following ways:

- Such a drop can increase the speed of the claim of the planets/stars/galaxies;
- Urbit will have a wider introduction to more communities (what's important is that those are communities that share the same vision and are technical);
- Urbit is your last computer that currently lacks indexing and a ranking mechanism - cyber provides this;
- An interplanetary system like Urbit needs an awesome base of knowledge inbuild into its machines and an ability to search trough it - cyber provides this;
- We see in Urbit a strategic ally in our mission to overthrow megacorps. Hopefully, Urbit can share this view and see us as equal. This in turn adds to the beneficial values of both;
- As Cyber grows, the Urbit community will have a rather serious bag of assets in the form of CYB tokens. This will give the Urbit community more power on every scale imaginary;
- Via the cyber~Urbit app the users of Urbit (and Cyber) will be able to promote Urbit by ranking the required information for this (SEO);
- Urbit can work on state of the art ML mechanisms with the help of Arvo and Cyber that can help to showcase the powers of Urbit;
- This can create a showcase for both projects and provide Urbit aliens with further gifts /drops, etc from other communities.

#### Conclusion

To our belief the cyber~Urbit app and this gift to the Urbit community can help both projects to grow exponentially in the future.
To achieve this, we will review this document (as can any community member). When this is done, we will proceed with an email of intentions to Tlon, followed by a proposal and some more community announcements. >>|

### First steps of cyber~University

On one hand, a lot of humans ask about use cases {~~for~>of~~} cyber. On the other hand, a lot of humans ask what content they have to cyberlink.

[This project](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/28/views/1) is a result of the brainstorming of cyber~Congress community. Some community members want to be involved in some issues. Some issues still don't have defined resources. Hope this roadmap will help everyone involved bootstrap the beast. >>|
